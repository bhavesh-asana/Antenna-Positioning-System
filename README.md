# Overview <a name="abstract"></a>
The idea is to develop an Internet of Things(IoT) based automated control system that is used to supervise the movement & an angle of a receiving antenna in all the possible directions. Here we use the NodeMCU and Arduino UNO micro-controllers to communicate across the sensors/actuators connected. It is a sensor-based system with a servo motor connected to a receving antenna to check its facing direction. Thus, the coordinates are sent to the end user over a secure communication channel.

This system allows to find the strength of a receving signal and 

 If the direction of a satellite or transmitting station changes over time, the antenna direction must also be changed accordingly. The receiving antennas may be placed far apart from each other across the globe. So our system allows for antenna positioning over very long distances. The antenna positions are visible over the internet to the controlling operator on the IoT GUI. We here use IOT Gecko to develop the antenna monitoring GUI system. Our system allows for monitoring antenna direction as well as transmitting new coordinates to position the antenna and the motor appropriately position the antenna accordingly.
