The idea is to develop a system that will control the movement of the antenna in all directions. Here we use a sensor-based system with the motor on each antenna to check its facing direction that is transmitted over IoT. If the direction of a satellite or transmitting station changes over time, the antenna direction must also be changed accordingly. The receiving antennas may be placed far apart from each other across the globe. So our system allows for antenna positioning over very long distances. The antenna positions are visible over the internet to the controlling operator on the IoT GUI. We here use IOT Gecko to develop the antenna monitoring GUI system. Our system allows for monitoring antenna direction as well as transmitting new coordinates to position the antenna and the motor appropriately position the antenna accordingly.
